# sphericalHarmonics

The software can be used to compute a field using a spherical harmonics description.

coeffLoader is an interface used to load the coefficients. coeffLoaderCSV is an implementation which loads the coefficients from CSV files, but you can write your own loader without modifying the class sphericalHarmonics.
